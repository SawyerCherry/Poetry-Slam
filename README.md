# Poetry-Slam

I have chosen a poem from robert Frost, Birches.
I start off by getting each line in a list in the get file lines.
then I get those lines printed backwards, not by character, but by line.
I also made a function to print random lines, then finally the custom function prints out every 
fifth line so you only get a total of 12 lines total. Not too creative, but it gets the job done, and it is within my skillset.
